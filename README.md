# What We're Building
```
Ridgemont High Student Interface 
--------------------------------
Welcome, Richard. Your access level is Principal
    What would you like to do?
    Options:
    1 List All Students
    2 View Individual Student <student_id>
    3 Add a Student
    4 Remove a Student <student_id>
    5 Quit
```

For this challenge we will be building a simple interface for a school that will keep track of student records. There are many ways to create the functionality we are looking for and you should feel free to experiment. We'll be using the menu above as a guide. By the end we'll be able to see a list of students, view an individual student's data, and create and delete records.
